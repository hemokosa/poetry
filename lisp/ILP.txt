This is The bracketed structure of CANTO III in “New Impressions of Africa” by Raymond Roussel (where [ ] denotes footnotes, ... denotes the text).

I will start with the following list poems (quotes from William Burroughs and Laurie Anderson):
(LANGUAGE IS A VIRUS FROM OUTER SPACE).

The second one is:
(PARADISE IS EXACTLY LIKE WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW).

The third one is:
(ONLY MUCH MUCH BETTER).

I want to manipulate these list poems like Roussel using GNU CLISP (ANSI Common Lisp).

% clisp
  i i i i i i i       ooooo    o        ooooooo   ooooo   ooooo
  I I I I I I I      8     8   8           8     8     o  8    8
  I  \ `+' /  I      8         8           8     8        8    8
   \  `-+-'  /       8         8           8      ooooo   8oooo
    `-__|__-'        8         8           8           8  8
        |            8     o   8           8     o     8  8

First, I assign each of the three poems to the symbol X Y Z.

> (setf X '(LANGUAGE IS A VIRUS FROM OUTER SPACE))
> (setf Y '(PARADISE IS EXACTLY LIKE WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW))
> (setf Z '(ONLY MUCH MUCH BETTER))

Next, I define a function to insert a list after the key.

> (defun insert-key (lst key ins)
    (push ins (cdr (member key lst))) lst)

For example, insert PLAN-9 and COVID-19 after VIRUS in X.

> (insert-key X 'VIRUS '(PLAN-9))
(LANGUAGE IS A VIRUS (PLAN-9) FROM OUTER SPACE)

> (insert-key X 'VIRUS '(COVID-19))
(LANGUAGE IS A VIRUS (COVID-19) (PLAN-9) FROM OUTER SPACE)

Further various list poems are inserted increasingly.

> (insert-key (nth 5 X) 'PLAN-9 '(WORST DIRECTOR AND WORST FILM EVER))

(LANGUAGE IS A VIRUS (COVID-19)
 (PLAN-9 (WORST DIRECTOR AND WORST FILM EVER)) FROM OUTER SPACE)

> (insert-key (nth 5 X) 'PLAN-9 '(ORIGINAL WINDOW SYSTEM IS CALLED |8-1/2|))

(LANGUAGE IS A VIRUS (COVID-19)
 (PLAN-9 (ORIGINAL WINDOW SYSTEM IS CALLED |8-1/2|)
  (WORST DIRECTOR AND WORST FILM EVER))
 FROM OUTER SPACE)

> (insert-key (nth 1 (nth 5 X)) '|8-1/2| '(​1963 ITALIAN SURREALIST  COMEDY-DRAMA FILM DIRECTED BY FEDERICO FELLINI))

(LANGUAGE IS A VIRUS (COVID-19)
 (PLAN-9
  (ORIGINAL WINDOW SYSTEM IS CALLED |8-1/2|
  (​1963 ITALIAN SURREALIST COMEDY-DRAMA FILM DIRECTED BY FEDERICO FELLINI))
  (WORST DIRECTOR AND WORST FILM EVER))
 FROM OUTER SPACE)

If the world of COVID-19 is, paradoxically, a paradise, then it should be much, much better.

> (insert-key (nth 4 X) 'COVID-19 Y)

(LANGUAGE IS A VIRUS
 (COVID-19 (PARADISE IS EXACTLY LIKE WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW))
 (PLAN-9
  (ORIGINAL WINDOW SYSTEM IS CALLED |8-1/2|
   (​1963 ITALIAN SURREALIST COMEDY-DRAMA FILM DIRECTED BY FEDERICO FELLINI))
  (WORST DIRECTOR AND WORST FILM EVER))
 FROM OUTER SPACE)

> (insert-key (nth 1 (nth 4 X)) 'PARADISE Z)

(LANGUAGE IS A VIRUS
 (COVID-19
  (PARADISE (ONLY MUCH MUCH BETTER) IS EXACTLY LIKE WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW))
 (PLAN-9
  (ORIGINAL WINDOW SYSTEM IS CALLED |8-1/2|
   (​1963 ITALIAN SURREALIST COMEDY-DRAMA FILM DIRECTED BY FEDERICO FELLINI))
  (WORST DIRECTOR AND WORST FILM EVER))
 FROM OUTER SPACE)

But the reality is reversible.

> (reverse X)

(SPACE OUTER FROM

 VIRUS A IS LANGUAGE)

 > (defun flatten (x)
  (labels ((rec (x acc)
                (cond ((null x) acc)
                      ((atom x) (cons x acc))
                      (t (rec (car x) (rec (cdr x) acc))))))
    (rec x nil)))

Society is flattening reversiblly.

> (flatten X)

Next, I define the Roussel macro.

(defun proto-roussel (tree leaf branch)
  (if tree
    (if (listp tree)
      (cons
        (proto-roussel (car tree) leaf branch)
        (proto-roussel (cdr tree) leaf branch))
      (if (funcall leaf tree)
        (funcall branch tree)
        tree))))

(defmacro roussel (tree leaf branch)
  `(proto-roussel
     ,tree
     (lambda (raymond)
       (declare (ignorable raymond))
       ,leaf)
     (lambda (raymond)
       (declare (ignorable raymond))
       ,branch)))

Roussel sent parts of his posthumous book “How I Wrote Certain of My Books” to the printer in 1932, the understanding was that the text would not be published while he was alive. The book describes how to compose Roussel's most famous works, “Impressions of Africa” and “Locus Solus”.

> (setf A '(HOW I WROTE CERTAIN OF MY CODES))
> (setf B '(IMPRESSIONS OF AFRICA))
> (setf C '(LOCUS SOLUS))

> (roussel A (equal raymond 'WROTE) (cons raymond B))

(HOW I (WROTE IMPRESSIONS OF AFRICA) CERTAIN OF MY CODES)

> (roussel A (equal raymond 'WROTE) (cons raymond C))

(HOW I (WROTE LOCUS SOLUS) CERTAIN OF MY CODES)

> (roussel
    (roussel A
      (equal raymond 'WROTE) (cons raymond B))
       (equal raymond 'WROTE) (cons raymond C))

(HOW I ((WROTE LOCUS SOLUS) IMPRESSIONS OF AFRICA) CERTAIN OF MY CODES)

Lisp isn't a language, it's a building material. — Alan Kay

> (setf I '(ARE NOT LANGUAGES))

> (setf P (roussel L (equal raymond 'CODES) (cons raymond I)))

(HOW I ((WROTE LOCUS SOLUS) IMPRESSIONS OF AFRICA) CERTAIN OF MY (CODES ARE NOT LANGUAGES))

> (setf RR (roussel P (equal raymond 'CODES) (cons raymond S)))

(HOW I ((WROTE LOCUS SOLUS) IMPRESSIONS OF AFRICA) CERTAIN OF MY
 ((CODES ARE BUILDING MATERIALS) ARE NOT LANGUAGES))

> (flatten RR)
